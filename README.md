### Petty? Maybe.


Online service\* for locating available laundry machines, providing information
such as:
 + Location on campus (college, building, floor/room)
 + Number of machines at a location
 + If a machine is available:
   + The availability next to the machine
 + If a machine is unavailable:
   + The availability next to the machine
   + When the machine will become available
   + A way to contact the previous user if the laundry has been done for a while (may just be a "poke" button that notifies them via sms/email)



\*(Really just a project to play around with databases)
